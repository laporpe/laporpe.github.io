I've enjoyed teaching several Software and Data Carpentries courses. The teaching philosophy of The Carpentries is:

> "By showing learners how to solve specific problems with specific tools and providing hands-on practice, we develop learnersâ€™ confidence and lay the foundation for future learning. A critical component of this process is that learners are able to practice what they are learning in real time, get feedback on what they are doing, and then apply those lessons learned to the next step in the learning process. Having learners help each other during the workshops also helps to reinforce concepts taught during the workshops.""
