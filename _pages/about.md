Hello, I'm a postdoctoral researcher at the [University of Arizona](https://thepaulilab.com/) with the [Institute for Computation and Data-Enabled Insight](https://datainsight.arizona.edu/)! I was previously a graduate student at the [University of California, Davis](https://diepenbrocklab.ucdavis.edu/) in the [Plant Biology Graduate Group](https://pbi.ucdavis.edu/) and [Plant Sciences Department](https://www.plantsciences.ucdavis.edu/).
