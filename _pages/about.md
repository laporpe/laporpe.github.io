Hello, I'm a graduate student at the [University of California, Davis](https://diepenbrocklab.ucdavis.edu/) in the [Plant Biology Graduate Group](https://pbi.ucdavis.edu/) and [Plant Sciences Department](https://www.plantsciences.ucdavis.edu/). 

`_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
